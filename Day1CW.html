        <p style="background-color:#0f0fff">A sari is a traditional garment worn by women in South Asia. It is a long piece of cloth, usually around 5 to 9 yards in length, that is draped elegantly around the body. Saris are known for their vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and luxurious fabrics such as silk, cotton, and chiffon. They are often adorned with embroidery, sequins, and other embellishments, making them suitable for both everyday wear and special occasions.
        Saris are typically paired with a fitted blouse called a choli and a petticoat. The way a sari is draped can vary based on regional styles and personal preferences. Wearing a sari requires some skill, as it involves pleating and tucking the fabric in specific ways to achieve the desired look. Saris are not only a symbol of cultural heritage but also a fashion statement, showcasing the rich textile traditions of South Asia.
